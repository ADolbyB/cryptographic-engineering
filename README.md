# Cryptographic Engineering in C Language

These are my projects from CDA-4321: Intro to Cryptographic Engineering.

Note that I used SageMath 10.0 as a Jupyter Notebook environment to check all C language algos.

To install SageMath 10.0 Environment on VS Code in Linux, follow these directions including installing `mamba` 
for faster dependency solving than `conda`: [Install Sage from conda-forge](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html)
